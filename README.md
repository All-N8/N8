## About N8

N8 was born from the merger of **Allym** and **N8**, combining the strengths of both to build a more powerful and versatile platform. We develop web and mobile applications designed to facilitate connections between event attendees, promoters, and organizers.

Our technology stack includes iOS and Android apps, admin dashboards, and integrations with Firebase, Stripe, and mapping services to provide a seamless and secure user experience.

Rooted in the vibrant event culture of Lisbon, N8 leverages advanced technologies — including AI-powered recommendations — to deliver meaningful and practical tools for its users.
